# py-wireframe-renderer
Quasi-rendering engine written in Python.

## Who does what here?

- **blenderToJSON.py**: He is a Blender script that exports 3D objects from Blender as JSON files.
- **draw3D.py**: He takes the JSON file and makes a Turtle drawing from it. :warning: SLOW :warning:
- **test9.json**: Example file. It is a hex nut. Takes about 3 minutes to render for me.
- **3dobj.schema.json**: JSON Schema for the JSON export.

## Does this work?
